# Sleep Duration, Difficulty, and Health Correlates Among U.S. Adults (NHANES 2009–2011)

![Cover Image](cover.png)


This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project examining the relationships between sleep duration, difficulty sleeping, and various health and lifestyle factors among U.S. adults.  

The analysis was performed using the **NHANESraw (2009–2011)** dataset collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

## Overview

This project investigates how demographic characteristics, physical health, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol use are associated with sleep quality and duration.  

All figures, tables, and statistical summaries presented in the final report can be **fully reproduced** using the included dataset and R code.

## Requirements

This analysis was conducted in **R** using the following packages:

```r
tidyverse
gridExtra
scales
broom
````

Ensure these are installed before running the `.Rmd` file:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "gridExtra", "scales", "broom"))
```
